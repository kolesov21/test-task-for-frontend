# Task-Frontend-1
The project is a panel for adding, deleting, updating and viewing the list of users. Operations are only available to authorized users, Auth0 was integrated for this purpose.

The frontend is made with Vue 3, Pinia, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. As for the backend, MongoDB database is integrated into the project, all data changes are saved in the database, Node.js and Express were used to communicate with the database. 

To run the project on Vercel hosting it was enough to log in to Vercel account via GitHub, then specify the repository to be used and Vercel itself launches the project in hosting and gives the link. 
The server for communication with MongoDB was hosted on Render, launched in the same way as on Verecel (just log in and specify the repository).
